# Wilford-Weather-Balloon

Hello!

Welcome to the attempt to recreate a interface of Weather Balloon control panel from Snowpiercer series into web-site form, just for fun. Nothing more. Maybee.

Plans to do: 
1) Fix layout as close as possible to original series UI.
2) Add media-queries for mobile devices.
3) Add interactivity, at least some links should work and perform something (that's in JS).
4) Add welcome window.
5) Find the font from the Snowpiercer series.
6) Add multi-language support?

And keep polishing the site or leave it as it is:
1) Add Semantic HTML.
2) Rewrite CSS into SCSS.
3) Rewrite CSS into BEM methodology.
